# one-shot-steel-surfaces

This repository contains the codes for the paper:  
**Deshpande, A. M., Minai, A. A., & Kumar, M. (2020). One-Shot Recognition of Manufacturing Defects in Steel Surfaces.** [arxiv-preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.05815)

#### CODE coming soon

## Dataset
You can get the dataset from the following website:

* NEU Steel Surface defect dataset [1]: [website](http://faculty.neu.edu.cn/yunhyan/NEU_surface_defect_database.html)

Sometimes, I have noticed that the server of this website is down and it cannot be reached.

In that case you can download the dataset from the following link directly:
* NEU surface defect database: [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B5OUtBsSxu1Bdjh4dk1SeGYtNFU)
